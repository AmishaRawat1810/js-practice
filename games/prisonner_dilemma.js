Imagine two friends, Alex 🥷 and Ben 🥷🏿, steal something together 💰. The police 🚓 catch them and put them in separate rooms, so they cannot talk to each other.

"You have two choices, Alex:

  1. Stay silent: If you don't talk 🤐 and your friend Ben also stays silent 🤐, both of you will go to jail ⛓️‍👮‍♂️ for only 1 year.
  2. Blame your friend: If you blame 🥷📢 Ben , but Ben stays silent 🤐, you will go free! Ben will go to jail ⛓️‍👮‍♂️ for 5 years.
  3. What if both blame each other? If both you 🥷 and Ben 🥷🏿 blame each other , both of you will go to jail ⛓️‍👮‍♂️ for 5 years."
